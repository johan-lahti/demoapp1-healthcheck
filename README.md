This is a simple demo-app. The app in itself is not for production 
or real-life purposes, but for demos of code management etc.

The demo-app is a basic app that is built on Flask and Genie,
the app runs a flask webserver when run, and replies to GET
with a json payload consisting networking data from devices
in the devices.yaml file.
